This app is the Vue version of a tech assesment that I was requested to do. 

Check my `posts-react` repository for a more detailed description.

The stack I used for this one is `Vite`, `Vue 3`, `Typescript`, `Vuex`, `Vitest`, `Tailwind Css` and `HeadlessUI`.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run dev

```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Run your unit tests

```
